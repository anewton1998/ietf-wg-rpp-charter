# Background and Problem Space

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) was standardized ([STD69](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/std69/)) 
in 2009 to address the needs of domain name management between domain name registries and registrars.
Though EPP is still serving the domain name industry well, the progress in available development, integration and operational
patterns, tools and technologies create a desire to have a provisioning protocol using the REST architectural style and the JSON data-interchange format.
Such design could take advantage of stateless architecture and widely deployed solutions such as OpenAPI with documentation,
testing and code generation tools and L4-L7 network services such as API gateways, authorization servers, load balancers, web servers, WAFs etc.
The recent deployment of RDAP in the domain name industry demonstrates adoption of this type of architecture.

This evolution already started in the ccTLD space and first production deployments of this approach have already seen
adoption by both existing clients and a preferred way of integration for new registrars.
A REST architecture may allow easier integration between registries and registrars, thus lowering the
costs for domain registration and new market entrants.

# Objective and Scope

This working group is tasked with creating a series of specifications
to be known collectively as RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP).
These specifications will specifically target a REST architecture high on the Richardson Maturity Model
using HTTPS and JSON. 

The working group will evaluate for possible inclusion of extensibility considerations, allowing
future use cases beyond the domain name provisioning as well as adding
or extending operations and data models defined in the core set of protocol specifications.

Industry experience and use cases from EPP may influence the outputs
of this working group, but direct compatibility of RPP with EPP is not
a goal.
The REGEXT working group is chartered to maintain and standardize extensions to EPP, therefore
extensions or changes for EPP are explicitly out of scope for the RPP working group.
Additionally, the activities of this working group are not intended to replace EPP nor
to suggest changes and extensions to EPP are no longer in scope of the IETF.
The RPP working group may however consider possibilities of mapping of data objects, operations and extensions from EPP to RPP for both clients and servers.

[BCP 56](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9205) will be used to guide the specification of RPP,
and the working group may evaluate the usage of URI and HTTP specifications such as 
[RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570), [RFC 8288](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288),
[RFC 9421](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421), [RFC 9652](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9652.html), 
and the outputs of the [httpapi working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpapi/about/).

# Deliverables

This working group will publish on its wiki its operational practices,
including but not limited to, the adoption of work items, usage of
tools beyond the IETF’s datatracker, and implementation requirements
for the promotion of work to the IESG.

This working group will find consensus on a set of core requirements for RPP.
In alignment with the [IESG's Statement on Support Documents dated 2023-08-24](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-support-documents-in-ietf-working-groups-20230824/),
these requirements will be publicly available on the working group's wiki.
Once established, these requirements may be changed through explicit working group
consensus and in consultation with the group’s responsible Area Director.
The finding of consensus for both the initial requirements and any changes will
be explicitly noted by the chairs on the working group's mailing list.

After finding consensus regarding requirements, the next documents to be delivered to the IESG 
by this working group will describe the core architecture and JSON mapping of RPP with regard to the
provisioning of domain names, followed by any specifications necessary
to implement the core architecture and the JSON mapping for the different objects to be provisioned.

The working group may also consider RPP extensions that are functional equivalents of registered [EPP extensions](https://www.iana.org/assignments/epp-extensions/epp-extensions.xhtml).

A written record of acceptance with an explanation of working group scope of I-Ds as working group work items 
is to be recorded with explicit acknowledgement of the chairs and published on the wiki.

# Coordination of work with other working groups
Some IETF participants are expected to be involved in both RPP and REGEXT working groups, and there may be some need for coordination between both groups.
